# Enhanced Lab Session Management - Testing Guide V2

## 🚀 New Features Implemented

### 1. Extended Session Metadata
- Admin must enter subject, faculty, year, department, section, and periods
- Year: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th options
- Department: CS, IT, Electronics, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical
- Section: A, B, C, or None
- All metadata displayed during session

### 2. Improved CSV Export

- **Shows ALL login/logout events** during session (multiple entries per student)
- **Chronological order** - sorted by login time
- **Dynamic student count** - varies based on actual attendance
- Enhanced header with year, department, section information

### 3. Persistent Student Tracking
- All student login/logout events tracked during entire lab session
- Multiple login/logout cycles per student properly recorded
- Complete attendance history maintained

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Server
cd central-admin\server
node app.js

# Terminal 2: Start Kiosk (for testing)
cd student-kiosk\desktop-app
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Enhanced Session Start
1. Open admin dashboard: `http://192.168.29.212:8000/admin-dashboard.html`
2. Click "🚀 Start Lab Session"
3. Fill in the enhanced dialog:
   - Subject: "Data Structures Lab"
   - Faculty: "Dr. Smith"
   - Year: 3rd Year
   - Department: Computer Science
   - Section: Section A
   - Periods: 2 (100 minutes)
4. Click "Start Session"
5. ✅ Verify session info appears with ALL metadata fields

### Step 3: Test Multiple Student Login/Logout Cycles
1. Login student via kiosk (e.g., CS2021001)
2. ✅ Verify student appears in admin dashboard
3. ✅ Verify screen mirroring auto-starts (CRITICAL - must work)
4. Logout student from kiosk
5. ✅ Verify logout time is recorded
6. Login SAME student again on different system
7. ✅ Verify new login is tracked as separate entry
8. Repeat with different students

### Step 4: Test Enhanced CSV Export
1. With students having logged in/out multiple times, click "📊 Export CSV"
2. ✅ Verify CSV downloads with:
   - **Enhanced session metadata** in header (year, department, section)
   - **ONLY students who logged in** (no ABSENT entries)
   - **ALL login/logout events** shown chronologically
   - **Multiple entries** for students who logged in/out multiple times
   - **Dynamic count** based on actual sessions
   - **Proper filename** with year and section info

### Step 5: Test Session End and Cleanup
1. Click "🛑 End Lab Session"
2. Confirm the dialog
3. ✅ Verify:
   - All student monitoring stops
   - Students grid clears
   - Session info disappears
   - Start button becomes enabled
   - Ready for next session

### Step 6: Test Different Session Configurations
1. Start new session with different metadata:
   - Subject: "Database Lab"
   - Faculty: "Prof. Johnson"
   - Year: 2nd Year
   - Department: Information Technology
   - Section: Section B
2. ✅ Verify all new metadata is properly stored and displayed

## 🚨 Critical Screen Mirroring Test

**MUST VERIFY:** Screen mirroring functionality is preserved:
1. Student logs in → Video should auto-start in admin dashboard
2. Video stream should work perfectly
3. Expand/fullscreen should work
4. WebRTC connection should be stable

## 📊 Expected Enhanced CSV Format

```csv
Lab Session Report
Subject: Data Structures Lab
Faculty: Dr. Smith
Year: 3rd Year
Department: Computer Science
Section: Section A
Duration: 2 periods (100 minutes)
Started: 10/14/2025, 6:45:00 AM
Generated: 10/14/2025, 7:30:00 AM
