# 🔧 LOGOUT/LOGIN SCREEN MIRRORING FIX

## ❌ THE PROBLEM

When a student:
1. ✅ Logs in → Screen mirroring works
2. 🔄 Logs out
3. 🔄 Logs in again → ❌ Screen mirroring fails!

**Why?** Two issues:

1. **Kiosk Side:** Old screen stream and peer connection not cleaned up
   - New session created with NEW session ID
   - But old resources still exist
   - Conflicts with new screen capture

2. **Admin Side:** `screenReadySessions` Set not cleared
   - Old session IDs accumulate
   - New session ID not recognized properly
   - Admin waits forever for screen-ready event

## ✅ THE FIX

### 1. Kiosk Cleanup (renderer.js)
Added automatic cleanup when new session starts:

```javascript
// Clean up previous session resources
if (localStream) {
  localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  localStream = null;
}

if (pc) {
  pc.close();
  pc = null;
}
```

**Result:** Fresh screen capture for each login

### 2. Admin Cleanup (admin-dashboard.html)
Clear screen-ready status on logout:

```javascript
socket.on('session-ended', (sessionData) => {
  removeStudentFromGrid(sessionData.sessionId);
  screenReadySessions.delete(sessionData.sessionId); // NEW!
});
```

**Result:** Clean state tracking

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added prominent console logs to track events:

**Kiosk:**
```
==============================================
🎉 EMITTING KIOSK-SCREEN-READY EVENT
Session ID: 68f0f92c57ba847648aebc39
Has Video: true
==============================================
```

**Admin:**
```
==============================================
🎉 ADMIN: KIOSK SCREEN READY EVENT RECEIVED
Session ID: 68f0f92c57ba847648aebc39
Has Video: true
==============================================
```

## 🚀 NOW TEST IT

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
cd central-admin\server
node app.js
```

### Step 2: Start Kiosk
```bash
cd student-kiosk\desktop-app
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Login → Logout → Login

1. **First Login:**
   - Student ID: `715524104152`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Lab: CC1, System: CC1-06
   - ✅ Screen mirroring should work

2. **Logout:**
   - Click logout button
   - ✅ Screen should disappear from admin

3. **Second Login:**
   - Same student ID and password
   - Same or different system
   - ✅ Screen mirroring should work again!

4. **Repeat multiple times:**
   - Login → Logout → Login → Logout
   - ✅ Should work every time!
