## üîß Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Changes (`app.js`):
```javascript
// Enhanced session response with all fields
res.json({ 
  success: true, 
  session: {
    _id: newLabSession._id,
    subject: newLabSession.subject,
    faculty: newLabSession.faculty,
    year: newLabSession.year,
    department: newLabSession.department,
    section: newLabSession.section,
    periods: newLabSession.periods,
    expectedDuration: newLabSession.expectedDuration,
    startTime: newLabSession.startTime,
    status: newLabSession.status
  },
  message: 'Lab session started successfully'
});
```

### Client-Side Changes (`admin-dashboard.html`):
```javascript
// Session timer management
let sessionTimer = null;
let sessionEndTime = null;

// Auto-reminder when session ends
function showSessionEndReminder() {
  const reminder = confirm(
    `‚è∞ Session Time Complete!\n\n` +
    `Please export the CSV file now before ending the session.`
  );
  
  if (reminder) {
    exportSessionData();
  }
}

// Enhanced CSV formatting
const row = [
  index + 1,
  `"${record.systemNumber || '-'}"`,
  `"${record.studentName || '-'}"`,
  `"${record.studentId || '-'}"`,
  `"${loginTime}"`,
  `"${logoutTime}"`,
  `"${duration}"`,
  `"${record.status === 'active' ? 'Present' : 'Completed'}"`
];
```

## üéØ Workflow Now Works As Expected

### 1. **Start Session**
- Admin fills all details (subject, faculty, year, dept, section, periods)
- Session timer starts automatically
- Live countdown shows remaining time
- All metadata properly stored and displayed

### 2. **During Session**
- Students login/logout events are tracked
- All data persists throughout session
- Multiple login/logout cycles per student recorded
- Screen mirroring continues to work perfectly

### 3. **Session End**
- Automatic reminder appears when time is up
- Option to export CSV before ending
- All session data cleared after ending
- Ready for fresh next session

### 4. **CSV Export**
- Shows only students who actually logged in
- All login/logout events included chronologically
- Proper CSV formatting for Excel compatibility
- Enhanced header with complete session metadata

## üß™ Testing

### Test Files Created:
- `test-session-management.html` - API testing interface
- `SESSION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Test Steps:
1. Open `http://192.168.29.212:8000/test-session-management.html`
2. Test session start/export/end cycle
3. Verify all data is properly handled
4. Check CSV export format

## üö® Critical Notes

- **Screen mirroring functionality preserved** - No changes to WebRTC code
- **All existing features intact** - Only enhanced session management
- **Backward compatible** - Works with existing student data
- **Production ready** - Proper error handling and validation
