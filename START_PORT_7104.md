# ✅ PORT CHANGED TO 7104 - FRESH START

## 🎯 WHAT CHANGED:

1. **✅ Port: 8000 → 7104**
2. **✅ Fixed connection preservation** - Won't keep failed connections
3. **✅ Fresh connections every time** - Old failed connections are closed

---

## 🚀 STARTUP COMMANDS (USE THESE NOW):

### **Terminal 1: Start Server**
```bash
cd d:\screen_mirror-1\central-admin\server
node app.js
```

**✅ WAIT FOR:**
```
✅ Server running on port 7104
🌐 Network Access: http://192.168.29.212:7104
```

### **Terminal 2: Start Kiosk**
```bash
cd d:\screen_mirror-1\student-kiosk\desktop-app
npm start
```

### **Browser: Open Admin**
```
http://192.168.29.212:7104/admin-dashboard.html
```

---

## ✅ WHAT'S FIXED:

### **Problem Before:**
```
❌ Admin was preserving FAILED connections
❌ Old connection state: "new" or "closed"
❌ Kept trying to use broken connections
❌ Never created fresh connections
```

### **Fixed Now:**
```
✅ Admin checks if connection is actually connected
✅ If connection failed → Close it and start fresh
✅ Fresh WebRTC connection every time
✅ Works even after logout/login
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

### **If Old Connection Failed:**
```
❌ Existing connection FAILED - starting fresh for: [session-id]
🎥 AUTO-STARTING fresh for: [session-id]
📤 Sending WebRTC offer to kiosk
✅ VIDEO TRACK RECEIVED
✅ Connected to session
```

### **If Old Connection Active:**
```
🔗 PRESERVING active connection for session: [session-id]
✅ Video stream still active
```

## 🎊 THIS SHOULD WORK NOW!

**Why?**
1. ✅ Fresh port (no old cached connections)
2. ✅ Fixed connection logic (closes failed connections)
3. ✅ Retry logic in kiosk (3 attempts if screen capture fails)
4. ✅ Auto-refresh every 3 seconds (never miss a login)
5. ✅ Dual-mode start (event + 5-second fallback)

**Start it now and it should work!** 🚀
